Don't you hate it when someone says, "write a bit about yourself." Like that is supposed to be easy. "Write what you know." Fuck you. You are always writing what you want the reader to know. I don't want the reader to know anything about me unless that reader is me, and I already know about me. There isn't anything that I could write that I want me to know that I don't already know. This may be my new LinkedIn profile.
