# Covid19.1
In 2020, every Data Scientist needs a Covid-19 dashboard. This one gets data from the NYT github repository and uses it for a Tableau Public dashboard. I live around DC, so it is focused on DC.
The dashboard is on Tableau Public: https://public.tableau.com/profile/michael.mcginnes#!/vizhome/DMVCovidCases/Dashboard1
I run the script and update the dashboard manually, so that doesn't happen every day. 
Click on the map to filter data to that county.
